# Graph-Dynamo

Graph-Dynamo is a computational framework developed to model cellular processes by leveraging the dynamical systems theory, addressing a significant bottleneck in genome-wide modeling due to the absence of sufficient quantitative data. This innovative framework is capable of extracting dynamical information from high-throughput snapshot single cell data, courtesy of advances in single-cell techniques.

## Features

1. **Tangent Space Projection (TSP)**:
   Graph-Dynamo introduces a graph-based machine learning procedure that constrains RNA velocity vectors to lie in the tangent space of the low-dimensional manifold represented by the single cell expression data. Unlike the traditional cosine correlation kernel, TSP maintains the vector's magnitude information while transitioning between different data manifold representations.

2. **Data-Driven Graph Fokker-Planck (FPE) Equation Formalism**:
   The framework incorporates a data-driven graph FPE equation formalism to model the cellular state transition dynamics as a convection-diffusion process on a data-formed graph network. This formalism ensures invariance under representation transformation while preserving the topological and dynamical properties of system dynamics.

3. **Dynamo Framework Integration**:
   Building upon our previously developed dynamo framework, Graph-Dynamo reconstructs genome-wide gene regulation relations from single-cell expression states and RNA velocity data derived from either splicing or metabolic labeling.

## Installation

```bash
pip install graph-dynamo
```

## Quick Start

WARNING: Underconstruction, please follow the notebooks folder for now.
After installation, you can easily start working with the `graph-dynamo` package:

```python
import graph_dynamo as gd

# Assuming data is loaded as data
tsp_result = gd.tangent_space_projection(data)
fpe_result = gd.graph_fokker_planck_equation(data)
```

## Documentation

The detailed documentation can be found at [Documentation Link](https://link_to_documentation)

## Usage Examples

```python
# More elaborate examples of how to use graph-dynamo
```

## Performance

Numerical tests on both synthetic data and experimental scRNA-seq data underline the capability of the Graph-Dynamo framework. By utilizing the graph TSP/FPE formalism constructed from snapshot single cell data, it successfully recapitulates system dynamics, marking a significant stride in single-cell studies and systems biology.
